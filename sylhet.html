                <h3>Ratargul Swamp Forest</h3>
                <p>A dense forest comprising mostly native hijol and koroch trees, Ratargul offers a sanctuary for different species of birds, monkeys, snakes and other reptiles.Ratargul is in close proximity of three rivers. Flowing respectively from the south and the east, the Chenger Khal and the Kafna meet near Ratargul and head north towards Guainghat under the nomenclature Guain. Once upon a time, the swamp forest occupied the banks of all these rivers. The water of these rivers makes its way into the forest and leaves it marooned under 15 to 20 feet water in the rainy season. With the bottom half of the dense forest covered under water and the top half visible with its multitudes of shades falling on crystal-clear water underneath, Ratargul makes for a sight that can soothe even the most uninterested of eyes.</p>
